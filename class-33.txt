vpc ---
create a vpc and cidr ranges
 
dev-vpc 10.0.0.0/16

tenancy most of the times default

you must DNS hostname change to enable

subnets:

pub-subnet-1a       10.0.0.0/24
private-sunnet-1a   10.0.1.0/24


pub-subnet-1b       10.0.2.0/24
private-sunnet-1b   10.0.3.0/24

pub-subnet-1c       10.0.4.0/24
private-sunnet-1c   10.0.5.0/24
