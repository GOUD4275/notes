scm -- repo-- branch :
devlop
main

dev
stage
prepod

 * never works on main branch ,
   our changes never do that main branch ,
   we must created new or own branch example feature branch or devlop branch name wise our          
   choice

we create a new branch use this command : 

git checkout -b feature-branch or devlop-branch


actually git never tracks files , this tracks commit id's only 

lab:
clone the existing repo
check the commits 
check the HEAD
check the commit changes

*create a new branch from main

*how many branches are there which command use?
git branch

*how to switching branch to branch ?
 git checkout main (example)
or git checkout master or git checkout feature-branch

what is the feature-branch ?
instead of working on the main targeted branch, i wanted to test my changes on specific branch , we use feature branch .


pull request ?
feature branch to main/devlop
merge the code /merge the commit 

what is branching strategy?
devlopers works on feature branch.
and test in one the environment.

dev team raise a PR / MR  to another branch (devlop)

then the test devlop branch in one of environment.

if all goes good
raise MR/PR to main .

if deleted one branch , don't stay in deleted branch switch on another branch

deleted command :

git branch -D feature-branch

remote changes bring the  local ,use this command:

git pull origin main

difference between git clone and git pull ?

git clone bring the all changes remote to local.

git pull only bring the new changes remote to local .


git clone: bring the existing repo total info to local.

pull : for the existing local repo, if we want to bring remote repo changes, we use pull.
