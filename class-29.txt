yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
mkdir -p /var/www/html/cricket/
echo "this is cricket" >/var/www/html/cricket/index.html


important note:

if you are search in browser this is cricket or this is football is not comming what is the reason is file is /var/www/index.html  inside so we are searching way is ip/cricket/index.html or ip/football/index.html page is comming in browser

not adding this scenario alb  before this comming do one thing edit inbound rules given 80 my ip  then it's come if not given this is not come 



create 2 target groups

then one alb loabbalancer


rules is goto the loadbalancer and click on the listeners view edit rules 
 given the /cricket/*   forward to the cricket
/football/* forward to the football

path is /cricket/*

path is /football/*


take alb dns name and search to the in browser and add to the end /cricket or /football it's now working
