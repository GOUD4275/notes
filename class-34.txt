ls -ltrh .pem ---- pem size is desplay
if you see the pem how many lines in pem file use this command----  wc -l .pem (l for lines, w --words ,c -- characters)

file creating using commands is :
vi --main use for this edit and create file purpose

if you see the content use this commands:
cat 
more
less


use example :  vi apache.pem
open another gitbash goto the downloads ,use cat keypair.pem 
taken data past to the bastion in vi apache.pem 

:wq!  --w -write ,q --quite ,!-- force to quite

owner:group:others


files = 666 umask = default permissions
directory = 777 umask = default permissions

pem files must 400 permissions , if we are change permissions use this command :        chmod 400 .pem


telnet ip port
nc -vz ip port   note  :  nc = netcat  : v = verboze 

remote port open or not checking purpose (source to destination)


remote machine means - apache
remote user - ec2

current user is - ec2 
current machine is - bastion


in this scenario  remote user and current user same so we donot need use : ec2-user@


curl /local /bastion /ip

if we are remove nat gateway it's not connecting to remote machine (apache)

then it's same way remove the igw we are not allow any machine

interview question:
* difference between public subnet and private subnet ?
* igw vs natgateway

(igw connects to the public ip: nat gateway  connects to the private ip)

in this scenario files means logs , suppose we see the last x days files created use this command - find
