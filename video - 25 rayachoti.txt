VPC - virtual private cloud --  cider range -- 172.31.0.0./16 (example see the number /16 )

subnets  ---- (172.31.0.0/20  example see the /20 )

example /20  = 30 - 20 = 12  2^12  = 4091

CIDR.xyz  search browser  how many ips allocating one subnet 

IGW - internet gate way --- automatically attached to the VPC

NGW - NAT gate way

sg - security group
sg is attache to vpc
it will have inbound and outbound rules
it will have only allow
state less


Nacl - network access control list
nacl must touch inbound and outbound rules
nacl is attached vpc 
it will hvae both ingress/egress rules
we will have both allow and deny

we will order of rules (which is the lowest number that is works )
0-22 allow ---- this works
1-22 deny 
2-22 allow
3-22 deny

Nacl is group of ec2  's providing network security
nacl attach to the subnets example ap-south-1a , ap-south-1b , ap-south-1c , nacl covers to the all subents.
nacl is for subnets ( in this subnets all components covers)
state less why because we are touch the both rules ( inbound and outbound)

what is the difference between system status checks and instance state ?

systemstatus check is fail what to do answer is stop and start (restart) this is aws problem

instance status check search of logs this is our problem


lab:
client---frontend----backend---rds
1) sg
2) frontend
3) backend
4) rds -instance databases 
    databases  --- (tables and columns)
    database = sql databases
    rows and columns = data
    what type of data = schma
    in aws data base is NoSQL = DynamoDB (unstructured data) example maps , youtube, flipkart search relative items also visible.
  * Never keep in RDS in public


 4.1) create subnet group.
 4.2) create sg


username : admin
password : 


Frontend-sg
22 - my IP
apache - 80 -- anywhere


backend-sg
22 - 
8080
