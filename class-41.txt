we create new git repositroy then goto the gitbash 
afterthat 

we are create another directory used by mkdir developer (example name developer)
in gitbash.

then bring the git clone code by git hub monolithic code


git pull -- auto merge

git fetch + git merge

lab:

shutdown ec2 evening -7pm and bring up 9 am
shutdown on weekend


yum update -y
yum install httpd git -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
ps -ef | grep "httpd"
systemctl status httpd
netstat -anlp | grep "80"
git clone https://github.com/GOUD4275/monolithic.git
cd monolithic 
cp -r * /var/www/html/


perf testing must see the loadbalancing


now we are adding another feature example careers.html 

go to the visual code add the careers.html

once you change the code we must enter the ec2 -machine after switching the root user
use the git clone command it's not working why because , previously we are cloning ,
so we do one thing use ls -l , use rm -rf (remove command) directory name
then use gitclone 
now this time working



cp -nrf monolithic/* /var/www/html/   ---direct not manualy cd monolithic not need
